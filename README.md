## How to install CircleGraph

### Through CocoaPods

If you didn't use CocoaPods before, install it first.

```terminal
$ gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup
```

If you don't have a Podfile yet, navigate to your project file and run:

```terminal
pod init
```
If the Podfile is there, simply append the following line to your Podfile.

```terminal
pod 'CircleGraph', :git => 'https://github.com/pmgeurts/CircleGraph.git'
```
Then, run this command. ðŸŽ‰

```
$ pod install
```
### Manually

Drag this file into your project.

CircleGrapph/CircleGraph.swift
And you can use CircleGraph. ðŸŽ‰

## How to use CircleGraph

<a name="how-to-use-circle-graph-programmatically"></a>
### Programmatically:
Use this method if you purely want to use code to instantiate your Circle Graph:

```Swift

//Instantiate graph:
let doubleArcGraph = CircleGraph(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 120, height: 120), strokeWidth: 15, passiveColor: UIColor.purple, activeColor: UIColor.magenta, inBetweenColor: UIColor.red)

//Add Subview:
let doubleArcGraph = CircleGraph(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 120, height: 120), strokeWidth: 15, passiveColor: UIColor.purple, activeColor: UIColor.magenta, inBetweenColor: UIColor.red)

//Set anchors:
NSLayoutConstraint.activate([ ... ])

//Call the graph method:
doubleArcGraph.drawTwoLayerArc(from: 0, to: 0.5, animationDuration: 0.5, animationType: .linear)
```

<a name="how-to-use-circle-graph-interface-builder"></a>
### Interface builder:
Use this method if you define your Circle Graph container view in your XIB / Storyboard:

```Swift

//Setup your container view in your view file

//Create an outlet:
@IBOutlet weak var: circleGRaphContainr: UIView!

//Create graph object:
- var threeArcGraph: CircleGraph!

//Setup circle graph (the frame is taken from the container bounds):
threeArcGraph = CircleGraph(frame: circleGraphContainer.bounds, strokeWidth: 20, passiveColor: UIColor.lightGray, activeColor: UIColor.red, inBetweenColor: UIColor.orange)

//Add Subview:
- circleGraphContainer.addSubview(threeArcGraph)

//Call the graph method:
- threeArcGraph.drawThreeLayerArc(from: 0.75, to: 0.5, inBetween: 0.4, animationDuration: 1.5, animationType: .easeInEaseOut)
```

## How to customize CircleGraph

<a name="how-to-customize-circle-graph-colors"></a>
### Colors
Passive color: Background circle
Active color: First animated circle
Second active color: Circle between passive color and active color

<a name="how-to-customize-circle-graph-direction"></a>
### Direction
Automatically determenied based on input values:
- From value smaller than to value: Clockwise
- From value bigger than to value: Counter clockwise
